Rem    NAME
Rem      utlprp.sql - Recompile invalid objects in the database
Rem
Rem    DESCRIPTION
Rem      This script recompiles invalid objects in the database.
Rem
Rem      This script is typically used to recompile invalid objects
Rem      remaining at the end of a database upgrade or downgrade. 
Rem 
Rem      Although invalid objects are automatically recompiled on demand,
Rem      running this script ahead of time will reduce or eliminate
Rem      latencies due to automatic recompilation.
Rem
Rem      This script is a wrapper based on the UTL_RECOMP package. 
Rem      UTL_RECOMP provides a more general recompilation interface,
Rem      including options to recompile objects in a single schema. Please
Rem      see the documentation for package UTL_RECOMP for more details.
Rem
Rem    INPUTS
Rem      The degree of parallelism for recompilation can be controlled by
Rem      providing a parameter to this script. If this parameter is 0 or
Rem      NULL, UTL_RECOMP will automatically determine the appropriate
Rem      level of parallelism based on Oracle parameters cpu_count and
Rem      parallel_threads_per_cpu. If the parameter is 1, sequential
Rem      recompilation is used. Please see the documentation for package
Rem      UTL_RECOMP for more details.
Rem
Rem    NOTES
Rem      * You must be connected AS SYSDBA to run this script.
Rem      * There should be no other DDL on the database while running the
Rem        script.  Not following this recommendation may lead to deadlocks.

DOC
   The following PL/SQL block invokes UTL_RECOMP to recompile invalid
   objects in the database. Recompilation time is proportional to the
   number of invalid objects in the database, so this command may take
   a long time to execute on a database with a large number of invalid
   objects.
  
   Use the following queries to track recompilation progress:
   
   1. Query returning the number of invalid objects remaining. This
      number should decrease with time.
         SELECT COUNT(*) FROM obj$ WHERE status IN (4, 5, 6);
   
   2. Query returning the number of objects compiled so far. This number
      should increase with time.
         SELECT COUNT(*) FROM UTL_RECOMP_COMPILED;
  
   This script automatically chooses serial or parallel recompilation
   based on the number of CPUs available (parameter cpu_count) multiplied
   by the number of threads per CPU (parameter parallel_threads_per_cpu).
   On RAC, this number is added across all RAC nodes.
  
   UTL_RECOMP uses DBMS_SCHEDULER to create jobs for parallel
   recompilation. Jobs are created without instance affinity so that they
   can migrate across RAC nodes. Use the following queries to verify
   whether UTL_RECOMP jobs are being created and run correctly:
  
   1. Query showing jobs created by UTL_RECOMP
         SELECT job_name FROM dba_scheduler_jobs
            WHERE job_name like 'UTL_RECOMP_SLAVE_%';
  
   2. Query showing UTL_RECOMP jobs that are running
         SELECT job_name FROM dba_scheduler_running_jobs
            WHERE job_name like 'UTL_RECOMP_SLAVE_%';

DOC
 The following query reports the number of objects that have compiled
 with errors.

 If the number is higher than expected, please examine the error
 messages reported with each object (using SHOW ERRORS) to see if they
 point to system misconfiguration or resource constraints that must be
 fixed before attempting to recompile these objects.
#
select COUNT(DISTINCT(obj#)) "OBJECTS WITH ERRORS" from utl_recomp_errors;


DOC
 The following query reports the number of errors caught during
 recompilation. If this number is non-zero, please query the error
 messages in the table UTL_RECOMP_ERRORS to see if any of these errors
 are due to misconfiguration or resource constraints that must be
 fixed before objects can compile successfully.
